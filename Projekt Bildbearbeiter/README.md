# Projekt Bildbearbeiter
 
This repository holds a simple image editing software, I made as an one-month project for school. It is entirely written in Pascal and uses the [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) to run and compile code.

## Practical Use

This program aims to be a versatile image processing software similar to [Paint.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint.net) with tools like resampling, sharpening, or color correction. 
The program has about 2500 lines of code, an included documentation and it can actually be used to edit pictures more flexible than with the old version of Windows Paint. This program will of course not replace an entire image editing software, and was rather a project to learn software development with Pascal.
 
## Running the Program

Not all files needed to run the project are included, as they are far too many. Building the project from the files would also take pretty long. Instead, I refer to the nice [documentation](https://github.com/HenningBeyer/Side-Projects/blob/main/Projekt%20Bildbearbeiter/Dokumentation/Dokumentation.pdf) file that includes enough images of the program, but also provide a runnable [.exe file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7UEE46qH1sEPApwUDhr0A-TCyybGHHi/view?usp=sharing) (if you really want to run the program, despite it beeing an .exe file [never recommended]).
