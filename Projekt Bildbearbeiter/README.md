## Projekt Bildbearbeiter
 
 This repo holds a project made from 2020 to 2021 during school, which aims to provide a large-scale image processing software similar to [Paint.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint.net). Functionality of the program include tools ranging from fundamental tools like the pencil tool to special tools like resampling, sharpening or a color correction.
 
This one-month-project has about 2500 lines of code, an included documentation and it can actually be used to edit pictures more flexible than with the classical Windows Paint. The project had to be entirely made in Pascal and its [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

Extra files that are needed to run the code are not included in this repo as the installing of of all components can be very cumbersome.

## Running the Program

A runnable .exe file is available in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7UEE46qH1sEPApwUDhr0A-TCyybGHHi/view?usp=sharing) and does not need any extra installations. To run the project simply execute the .exe file and start editing or opening an image file.

Otherwise, make sure to also have a look in the project's basic documentation.
