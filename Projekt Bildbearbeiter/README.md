 ## Project 'Bildbearbeiter'
 
 This repo holds a project made from 2020 to 2021 during school time, which aims to provide a large-scale image processing software similar to [Paint.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint.net). Functions of the program 'Bildbearbeiter' include common tools ranging from fundamental tools as the pencil tool to several special tools like resampling, sharpening or a color correction placed on a intuitive GUI.
 
All in all, this project has about 2500 lines of code, an included documentation and it can actually be used to edit pictures more flexible than with the classical Windows Paint. The project had to be entirely made in Pascal which now has a handy [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) for application development.

Extra files that are needed to run the code are not included in this repo as the installing of of all components can be very cumbersome.

### Running the Program

A runnable .exe file is available in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7UEE46qH1sEPApwUDhr0A-TCyybGHHi/view?usp=sharing) and does not need any extra installations. To run the project simply execute the .exe file and start editing by creating or opening an image file inside the program.

Make sure to also have a look in the project documentation.
