# Deforum-Art-Project

## Overview

This is a medium-sized project for an art homework given about 'Your Future in x Years' which was entirely generated by a Stable Diffusion AI model. The depicted story should represent the inner thoughts of an arbitrary man - a physicist - whose entire life replays itself one last time before he passes away as of his great age. This should not only symbolize a potential future but also how life slips by so fast, just leaving void no matter how strong the achievements and impressions.

### Effort

It took mainly reasearching effort and effort for fine-tuning the parameters on the public notebook [Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb) like for adjusting the camera movement and the noise schedules. Open these notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an adequate format. Some notes and useful sources are provided alongside the written prompts of +500 words. 

It took about 18 hours to render the animation in Colab with the free Tesla T4 GPU and about 40 hours to prepare the notebook. Shotcut as a video editing software was very handy for upscaling to 4k and interpolating to 180 fps in just 20 min compared to other methods.
