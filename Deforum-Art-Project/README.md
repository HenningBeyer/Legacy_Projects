# Deforum-Art-Project

## Overview

This is a medium-sized project for an art homework given about 'Your Future in x Years' which was entirely generated by a Stable Diffusion AI model. The depicted story should represent the inner thoughts of an arbitrary man - a physicist - whose entire life replays itself one last time before he passes away as of his great age. This should not only symbolize a potential future but also how life slips by so fast, just leaving void no matter how strong the achievements and impressions.

It took mainly reasearching effort and effort for finding the required parameter setting on a public notebook called [Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb) which included adjusting the camera movement and the noise schedules. Please consider to open these notebooks only in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an adequate format.
Some notes, useful sources and researched artist styles are provided with the notebook and its written prompts of +500 words. 

### Effort

It took about 18 hours to render the animation in Colab with the free Tesla T4 GPU and about 40 hours to prepare the notebook. Shotcut as a video editing software was very handy for upscaling to 4k and interpolating to 180 fps in just 20 min compared to all other methods.
