# Deforum-Art-Project

## Overview

This is a medium-sized project for an art homework given about 'Your Future in x Years' which was entirely generated by a Stable Diffusion AI model. It took mainly reasearching effort and effort for finding the required parameter setting on a public notebook called [Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb) which included adjusting the camera movement and the noise schedules. Please consider to open these notebooks only in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an adequate format.

Some notes, useful sources and researched artist styles are provided with the notebook and its written prompts of +500 words. The depicted story should represent a man studying physics and getting older while he is envisioning parts of his earlier life. Towards the end, his toughts are moved to his slowly approaching death.

### Effort

It took about 18 hours to render the animation in Colab with the free Tesla T4 GPU and about 40 hours to prepare the notebook. Shotcut as a video editing software was very handy for upscaling to 4k and interpolating to 180 fps in just 20 min compared to all other methods.
